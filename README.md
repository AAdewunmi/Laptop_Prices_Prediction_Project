# ðŸ’» Laptop Price Prediction

This project predicts laptop prices based on various features using supervised machine learning techniques. It covers the full data science workflow: data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## Features Used

- Company
- TypeName
- Inches

## Workflow

1. **Data Loading:** Reads data from `sample_data/laptop_data.csv`.
2. **EDA:** Visualizes distributions, relationships, and categorical counts.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Extracts and transforms features (e.g., CPU type, storage, screen resolution).
4. **Model Building:** Trains multiple regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Uses `RandomizedSearchCV` for optimal model parameters.
6. **Evaluation:** Compares actual vs. predicted prices, visualizes results.
7. **Model Persistence:** Saves trained models and processed data for deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- See `requirements.txt` for dependencies (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, xgboost)

### Installation

```sh
pip install -r [requirements.txt](http://_vscodecontentref_/4)
```

### Usage

- Open Laptop_Price_Predictor.ipynb in Jupyter or VSCode.
- Run cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and model training.
- Trained models and processed data are saved in sample_data/Trained_Model/.

### Data

- The dataset is located at sample_data/laptop_data.csv.

### Results

- Multiple regression models are compared.
- The best-performing model is saved as pipe.pkl and laptoppricepredictor.pkl.
- Visualizations show feature importance and prediction accuracy.
